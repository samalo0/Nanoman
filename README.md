Android version of the NES classic, Megaman.

Minimum Android version is 19 (Kitkat 4.4).
It is possible to use a game pad (tested with a few Logitech) by going into setup and defining the buttons.

I believe I have improved upon the original game in many ways; give it a try and let me know what you think or if you find any bugs. It is beatable but there is no ending currently.
